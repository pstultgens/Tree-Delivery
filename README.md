# Tree-Delivery
 
Tree Delivery is a game that aims to make learning the Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure enjoyable. The game was developed with the Unity Game Engine as part of a Master's Thesis in Software Engineering. It provides players with a 2D top-down delivery adventure within the nodes and edges of a BST racing track.

In the game, players navigate through the tree while encountering packages, traps, obstacles, and AI-driven vehicles, adding an element of exploration and surprise. The main objective is to deliver packages to the correct tree nodes as quickly as possible. As players progress through the game, they solve the tree and advance to higher levels in order to achieve the highest score. 

To cater to different skill levels, Tree Delivery offers varying difficulties, hints, and feedback based on a pre-knowledge test. With each level, the challenges become more intense, allowing players to master common problems and difficulties associated with BSTs, such as inserting values at the wrong place or removing nodes with children.

By gamifying the learning process, Tree Delivery not only provides enjoyment and excitement but also ensures a comprehensive understanding of Binary Search Trees through engaging gameplay.

This game is the product of my Thesis: "Developing a game for undergraduate computer science students to learn data structures" and in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Software Engineering at the Open University The Netherlands.
